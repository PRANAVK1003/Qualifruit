## 🍎 Fruit Quality Detection & Price Estimation using ML & Computer Vision

An end-to-end Machine Learning and Computer Vision project that detects the quality of fruits (Fresh, Rotten, etc.) using image data and predicts pricing based on quality and type. Built to support farmers, vendors, and supply chains in automating fruit sorting, reducing waste, and improving efficiency.

### 🚀 Features

- 🧠 **Image-based Quality Detection** using ML & CV techniques  
- 📸 **Custom Dataset** of labeled fruit images (Fresh, Rotten, Spoiled)
- 🔍 **Image Preprocessing & Augmentation** for better model generalization
- 🧪 **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for high-accuracy classification
- 💰 **Dynamic Price Estimation** based on fruit type + detected quality
- 📊 **Visualizations & Model Evaluation** using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall
- 🛠️ **Modular Codebase** for easy scaling to other fruits or quality categories

---

### 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Python**  
- **OpenCV** – Image processing  
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – Deep learning models  
- **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib** – Data handling and visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – Preprocessing and metrics  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** – Development and experiments

---

### 💡 Use Cases

- Automated fruit sorting in farms or warehouses  
- Smart vending or self-checkout systems in supermarkets  
- Reducing food waste by early detection of spoilage  
- Helping farmers get fair prices based on quality grading
